WHAT I LEARNED

This was my first time using WordPress as a headless CMS with WPGraphQL. I learned:

How to map ACF fields into the GraphQL schema

How to resolve schema errors and plugin conflicts

How to rebuild a custom taxonomy and field group

How to validate schema output in the Apollo GraphQL Sandbox

How to fetch and render dynamic WordPress data inside React

How to match a complex Figma layout from scratch

I entered this with no headless WordPress experience and worked through multiple technical challenges until the project ran end-to-end.

PROFESSIONAL CONTEXT

I completed this assignment while working my full-time job at Toftrees Golf Resort & Conference Center, where I work in four different departments:

Front Desk

Housekeeping

The Field (restaurant) as a server

Banquets as a banquet server

I am the only employee who works across all departments.
I even gave up a shift this week so I could finish this project.

This ability to wear many hats is exactly why I pushed through technologies I hadn’t used before. I’m committed to learning and always give 110%.

WHY I WANT THIS ROLE

This project showed me how much I love solving complex problems, even when they start out overwhelming. I learned a tremendous amount in a short time and proved to myself that I can adapt quickly under pressure.

I’m eager to keep growing, learning, and giving everything I have to a team that values creativity, persistence, and problem-solving.
